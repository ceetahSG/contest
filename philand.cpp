// In the mystical land of Phi, there lived legendary coders. One day, the king of Phi-land, intrigued by this coder’s abilities, devised a challenge to test the wit of his students.

// The king declared, "I will give a string, " Phitron ". Your task is to transform it and present it back to me in a manner such as " nortihp ". I won’t reveal the exact steps, but only the sharpest mind will understand my intention."

//     The king handed over the string and left,
//     confident that only one student would be clever enough to unravel the true requirement.

//     The student is YOU !Now,
//     it’s your turn to rise to the challenge and demonstrate your mastery to the king.The king will give you a string, and your task is to transform it and present it exactly as the king desires.Only the cleverest will succeed — will you be the one to impress the king ?
